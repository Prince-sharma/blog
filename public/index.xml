<ol>
<li>
<p>Best in class UX for document processing and review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bridges the gap between traditional document processing tools (Abbyy, Kofax) and innovative AI-first competitors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combines LLMs assisted OCR with deep industry-specific ML models for financial sector</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Strategic positioning plan to capture more of the mid-market segment</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>P0: Strengthen the document AI standing on the financial and lending business by improving accuracy for new unstructured document and integrations to seamlessly integrate into the workflow</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Reduce the time for first document data extraction with high accuracy for any uploaded document type using LLM assisted document processing, prebuilt workflows for major use cases, etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build native integration for customers to easily integrate into any workflows, allowing input and export of data into various platforms. Integrate systems used by financial and lending companies to allows support in the end to end lifecycle of document processing</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>P1: Build robust workflow builder with semantic understanding and vertical specific solutions to move up the value chain</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Eg. Fraud detection for the uploaded documents</p>
<ol>
<li>Since the financial company is dependent on Docsumo to get the data extracted from the customer document, flagging fraudulent document can be competitive advantage</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>P2: Expand into other similar sectors and go deep based on adoption and customer feedback</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what-would-your-3-month-6-month-and-12-month-product-vision-look-like">What would your 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month product vision look like?</h3>
<p><strong>Features / capabilities we should prioritize to align with Docsumo&rsquo;s mission</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Traditional OCR systems primarily rely on pattern recognition and template matching to convert images of text into machine-readable formats, LLMs improve upon these shortcomings by leveraging their ability to understand context and semantics. Unlike traditional OCR, LLMs interpret text meaning, fixing errors and ensuring better accuracy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LLM-assisted OCR has greatly improved the accuracy of processing unstructured documents, even with minimal training. However, the market response varies:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Established players</strong> like Abby and Kofax have strong enterprise business workflow integrations but are slow to adopt LLM-assisted OCR</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Newer competitors</strong> like Hyperscience and Instabase focus on LLM-first products but struggle with product depth required for enterprises and high-scale document processing (source: <a href="https://www.g2.com/products/hyperscience/reviews#reviews">G2 reviews</a>)</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>LLM tools by themselves cannot solve enterprise use cases. Docsumo holds a unique competitive advantage by balancing both extremes. It offers highly accurate models for document classification and data extraction, tailored for financial services and commercial lending. Additionally, it provides seamless enterprise workflow integration and use-case-specific product optimizations for various document types</p>

<p>Risks / challenges of using LLMs</p>
<ol>
<li>When using a hybrid LLM and OCR systems, Issues such as error diagnosis in hybrid systems—determining whether an error arose from the OCR or the LLM—pose significant hurdles</li>
</ol>
</li>

<h3 id="other-strategic-opportunities-emerging-due-to-llms">Other strategic opportunities emerging due to LLMs</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p> Ability of LLMs to understand context and semantics for a given document file of any format opens up new use cases and markets. One of the key advantages of LLMs is their capability to interpret the meaning behind the text they process. LLMs can discern context and correct typographical errors based on surrounding information</p>

<h3 id="case-study-tasks"><strong>Case Study Tasks:</strong></h3>
<p>Use the structure below to complete your case study submission:</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>1. Market Research &amp; Competitive Analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> How would you analyze the competitive landscape for Docsumo, given the established players and new-age competitors (Abbyy, Kofax, Google Document AI, etc.)?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Identify the key differentiators for Docsumo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Propose a strategic positioning plan to capture more of the mid-market segment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>**Context from Product Thesis:**Docsumo excels in document classification and data extraction from complex unstructured documents with a higher accuracy rate than traditional OCR tools. Additionally, Docsumo’s ability to process diverse document types at scale is a competitive advantage, especially in areas like financial services and commercial lending​</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>2. Product Vision &amp; Roadmap (3, 6, and 12 months):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What would your 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month product vision look like?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Which features or capabilities would you prioritize to align with Docsumo&rsquo;s mission?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How will you balance short-term wins with long-term product scalability?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>**Context from Product Thesis:**Docsumo’s roadmap needs to focus on enhancing its AI models for increased accuracy and expanding integrations to become a core part of enterprise workflows. The product vision should be centered on creating a seamless customer experience, addressing current pain points like manual processes, and driving automation​.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>3. Customer Segmentation &amp; Use Cases:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> How would you define the ideal customer profile for Docsumo?</p>
<ul>
<li>Which specific use cases will you prioritize (e.g., customer onboarding, claims processing) to demonstrate immediate value?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>**Context from Product Thesis:**Mid-market financial services, commercial lending and B2B technology companies are a primary target, given their reliance on document-heavy processes. The use cases around automating manual data entry from bank statements, payment processing, and tax documents are key areas where Docsumo can demonstrate significant ROI</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>4. Success Metrics &amp; Adoption Strategy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What success metrics would you track to gauge the impact of newly launched features?</p>
<ul>
<li>How would you drive feature adoption among customers?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>**Context from Product Thesis:**The success of new features should be measured through user engagement (e.g., feature usage, reduction in manual errors, time savings) and business outcomes (e.g., increased customer retention, decreased churn). Adoption should be driven through targeted customer education and onboarding strategies​.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>5. Go-to-Market Strategy for New Integrations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> How would you approach the go-to-market strategy for new integrations?</p>
<ul>
<li>The integrations are for Google Drive, Box, Dropbox, S3, SharePoint, and OneDrive for imports; Google Sheets and Smartsheet for exports.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>**Context from Product Thesis:**Docsumo currently allows document uploads via API, email forwarding, and Zapier, but a broader strategy is needed to provide native integrations. The addition of these key integrations will streamline customer workflows, allowing them to manage the entire process within Docsumo​. Your strategy should include clear communication on the value these integrations provide and a launch plan targeting mid-market customers who rely on cloud-based document storage solutions.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>6. User Research &amp; Feedback Loop for Integrations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> How would you integrate user feedback into the product lifecycle, specifically for the new integrations?</p>
<ul>
<li>What mechanisms will you use to gather feedback and iterate on the feature post-launch?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>**Context from Product Thesis:**Establishing a continuous feedback loop is crucial. You can leverage in-app surveys, interviews, and analytics to understand how customers interact with these integrations. Iteration should focus on ensuring seamless document flow from third-party storage solutions into Docsumo and vice versa​.</p>
