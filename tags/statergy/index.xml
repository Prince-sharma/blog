<p>IDP automates the handling of documents including data capture, document classification, data extraction, validation and Integration for companies who rely heavily on processing documents to make business decisions</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Regional banks</strong> depend on processing documents for processing loans, updating customer information (beneficiary, ) and many other workflows</p>
<ol>
<li>Example documents: Bank Statements, Tax Returns, Financial Statements, Business Licenses, Collateral Documents</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Insurance Companies (**National Life Group, Employers Insurance) depend on document processing to process insurance claims and also issue insurance</p>
<ol>
<li>Property deed, home inspections reports, etc</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Alternative Lenders (**OnDeck Capital, Kabbage, BlueVine, Fundbox, Celtic Bank, etc) depend on processing customer bank statements, etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Equipment Finance</strong> (TimePayment, Ascentium Capital) companies depend on document processing for evaluating loan parameters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Healthcare Organizations, Legal Firms, Manufacturers, Government Agencies also process high volume of complex documents to run their business processes</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="competitors">Competitors</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ideal customer profile and their requirements (excluding large enterprise customers)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Let’s consider a mid-size US commercial lender (500-1,000 employees), processing 200-500 loan applications monthly with legacy software that requires significant manual data entry, leading to delays and errors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their focus is on reducing manual processing time to minimize lost deals, improving accuracy to cut error-related losses, enhancing customer experience with faster processing, ensuring compliance, and achieving ROI through better staff efficiency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence the key factors for solution evaluation criteria include data accuracy, processing speed, document versatility, seamless integration, security compliance, cost-effectiveness, vendor reliability, and ease of training and use</p>
</li>

<p>Key differentiators and competitive advantage of DocSumo</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Best in class UX for document processing and review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bridges the gap between traditional document processing tools (Abbyy, Kofax) and innovative AI-first competitors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combines LLMs assisted OCR with deep industry-specific ML models for financial sector</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Strategic positioning plan to capture more of the mid-market segment</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>P0: Strengthen the document AI standing on the financial and lending business by improving accuracy for new unstructured document and integrations to seamlessly integrate into the workflow</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Reduce the time for first document data extraction with high accuracy for any uploaded document type using LLM assisted document processing, prebuilt workflows for major use cases, etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build native integration for customers to easily integrate into any workflows, allowing input and export of data into various platforms. Integrate systems used by financial and lending companies to allows support in the end to end lifecycle of document processing</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>P1: Build robust workflow builder with semantic understanding and vertical specific solutions to move up the value chain</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Eg. Fraud detection for the uploaded documents</p>
<ol>
<li>Since the financial company is dependent on Docsumo to get the data extracted from the customer document, flagging fraudulent document can be competitive advantage</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>P2: Expand into other similar sectors and go deep based on adoption and customer feedback</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Features / capabilities we should prioritize to align with Docsumo&rsquo;s mission</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Traditional OCR systems primarily rely on pattern recognition and template matching to convert images of text into machine-readable formats, LLMs improve upon these shortcomings by leveraging their ability to understand context and semantics. Unlike traditional OCR, LLMs interpret text meaning, fixing errors and ensuring better accuracy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LLM-assisted OCR has greatly improved the accuracy of processing unstructured documents, even with minimal training. However, the market response varies:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Established players</strong> like Abby and Kofax have strong enterprise business workflow integrations but are slow to adopt LLM-assisted OCR</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Newer competitors</strong> like Hyperscience and Instabase focus on LLM-first products but struggle with product depth required for enterprises and high-scale document processing (source: <a href="https://www.g2.com/products/hyperscience/reviews#reviews">G2 reviews</a>)</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>LLM tools by themselves cannot solve enterprise use cases. Docsumo holds a unique competitive advantage by balancing both extremes. It offers highly accurate models for document classification and data extraction, tailored for financial services and commercial lending. Additionally, it provides seamless enterprise workflow integration and use-case-specific product optimizations for various document types</p>

<h2 id="assumptions-and-appendix">Assumptions and appendix</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Competitor analysis is done keeping mid market customers in mind where we have different team who can try the solution and take decision independently</p>
<ol>
<li>Enterprises can have a vastly different evaluation criteria where they issue tenders and solution providers then submit proposal, etc and have much larger closing cycles</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have not talked to actual customers and hence would want to validate hypothesis presented in this doc and get more insights into their needs and end to end workflows before implementing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risks / challenges of using LLMs</p>
<ol>
<li>When using a hybrid LLM and OCR systems, Issues such as error diagnosis in hybrid systems—determining whether an error arose from the OCR or the LLM—pose significant hurdles</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="other-strategic-opportunities-emerging-due-to-llms">Other strategic opportunities emerging due to LLMs</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p> Ability of LLMs to understand context and semantics for a given document file of any format opens up new use cases and markets. One of the key advantages of LLMs is their capability to interpret the meaning behind the text they process. LLMs can discern context and correct typographical errors based on surrounding information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vertical solutions lending companies, to add rules and business context for their process approvals into their IDP systems, suggest decision in addition to the correct texts</p>
