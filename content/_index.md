# Prince Sharma

Hey there, this is Prince. I like Ghibli movies, teking. A quote I really like from the lord of the rings.

> “Frodo: I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened.
> Gandalf: So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide.
> All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.”
>
> --- [Lord Of the Rings](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1046665-frodo-i-wish-the-ring-had-never-come-to-me)

> "Let everything happen to you
> Beauty and terror
> Just keep going
> No feeling is final"
>
> --- [Rainer Maria Rilke](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/95915-let-everything-happen-to-you-beauty-and-terror-just-keep)

I'm currently working on building: 
1. **Wingman** is a AI companion for Indian who you can talk to on WhatsApp. Try by texting the number here: http://wa.me/919643516428?text=hi 
2. **Firsco Post Purchase** is the fastest way to enable post-purchase notifications on your Shopify store. Currently working on building the MVP for this.
