# What Should I Work On For The Next 10 Years? A Methodological Approach To Choosing My Life's Work

## The Startup Ideas On My Radar

Here's what's been keeping me up at night:

**1. AI Workers**  
Could we build AI lawyers? Virtual assistants that *actually* understand context? Tools that handle repetitive cognitive work?

**2. Document Intelligence**  
AI that doesn't just analyze documents, but *acts* on them. Think automatic note-taking systems that turn meeting transcripts into action items.

**3. Consumer AI Companions**  
Not just chatbots - true digital partners that evolve with users over time. The Tamagotchi of the AI era, but with real utility.

## Why Gaming Might Be The Perfect Testbed

While researching, I stumbled upon [Altera's Minecraft AI agents](https://altera.al/) - NPCs that learn, collaborate, and remember. This sparked an important realization: **The gaming industry might be the petri dish where AI evolution becomes visible first**.

### Three Key Questions About Gaming's Future

1. **Why Do Games Work?**  
   - Storytelling (Batman Arkham's iconic dialogues)  
   - Social connection (Fortnite's virtual hangouts)  
   - Immersive worlds (Elden Ring's environmental storytelling)

2. **Historical Tech Shifts**  
   - Browser games (Flash era)  
   - Mobile revolution (Angry Birds effect)  
   - Cloud gaming (Xbox Game Pass model)

3. **The AI Impact**  
   Could this be bigger than mobile? Two scenarios:

---

### Scenario 1: The Base Case (Incremental Improvements)
- **NPCs 2.0**: Characters with dynamic dialogues vs scripted lines  
- **Procedural Content**: AI-generated worlds like No Man's Sky on steroids  
- **Developer Tools**: 50% faster game development through AI-assisted coding

*Metric to Watch*: Steam's "New Releases" counter - if it spikes, AI is lowering development barriers.

---

### Scenario 2: The Hero Case (Paradigm Shift)
- **Personalized Stories**: Games that adapt to your playstyle like a human DM  
- **AI Co-Creation**: Players helping design games through natural language  
- **Cross-Platform Agents**: Your Clash of Clans army remembers you from PC to mobile

*Metric to Watch*: Average playtime per user - if this jumps, AI is creating stickier experiences.

## The Billion Dollar Question

**Will this actually matter?**  

The gaming AI market is projected to grow from $0.5B (2023) to $7.5B by 2032 ([Allied Market Research](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com)). But numbers aside, three trends convince me:

1. **The Graphics Parallel**  
   GPUs gave us photorealistic games. LLMs could give us emotionally-real NPCs.

2. **The Attention Economy**  
   TikTok proved short-form works. AI could enable "snackable" gaming experiences.

3. **The Labor Math**  
   AAA games take 5+ years to develop. Cut that to 2 years through AI, and you get 10x more experiments.

---

## My Personal Checklist

Before jumping in, I'm pressure-testing this through:

1. **Unfair Advantage Check**  
   Do I have unique insights into gaming/AI intersections? (Maybe - built ML systems before)

2. **10-Year Test**  
   Would I enjoy talking to game developers daily for a decade? (Leaning yes)

3. **Business Model Stress Test**  
   Enterprise (sell to EA) vs Consumer (build new Roblox) approaches

---

## Next Steps

1. **Talk to 10 Game Devs**  
   Validate pain points around NPC development/testing

2. **Prototype an AI DM**  
   Simple text adventure using GPT-4 + long-term memory

3. **Monitor Key Metrics**  
   - Steam's concurrent user numbers  
   - Unity's AI tool adoption rates  
   - App store revenue for "AI-powered" games

## List of All the Things I Could Be Doing Right Now

### To Do
1. Look at YC startup directory, especially for companies working with LLMs  
> The market is very large, and the cost of experimentation is low  
2. Look at other startup databases: Who's getting funded?  
3. What is my unfair advantage? What type of customers do I enjoy working with? What problem can I work on for the next 10 years of my life?  

Use Gemini? Gork?  

### What I Know Works  
1. **AI Workers**  
    1. AI lawyer  
    2. AI assistant  

2. **Analyze Documents and Take Action**  
    1. AI note-taking  
    2. [To be expanded]  

3. **Consumer Tech**  
    1. AI companion

# What Should I Work on for the Next 10 Years? Asking the Questions Seriously and Methodologically  

Researchers at MIT and Stanford—neuroscientists and physicists—are working on AI agents with coherence, long-term autonomy, collaboration, episodic memory, and more.  

https://altera.al/  

They built an AI agent to play Minecraft with you.  

This leads me to think: Companies will continue working on AI agents for the next decade. Even if they don’t achieve AGI, there will still be progress. At minimum, we can expect current AI costs to drop, making existing capabilities cheaper and more accessible. New abilities may also emerge.  

This makes me wonder: **What are the long-term effects of AI interacting with humans?**  

That’s too broad. Let’s focus:  

**What will happen to gaming in the next 10 years as AI advances?**  

### Let’s Break This Down  

1. **What makes gaming successful?**  
> Games come in many forms (single-player, multiplayer, competitive), but key elements include:  
    1. Compelling stories and dialogues (e.g., Batman Arkham Knight’s iconic Joker/Batman interactions)  
    2. Social multiplayer experiences (playing with friends)  
    3. NPC behavior, dialogues, and cutscenes that enhance immersion  

2. **Past Tech Shifts in Gaming**  
    1. Early internet enabled browser-based multiplayer games (e.g., Flash games)  
    2. Mobile + social media reduced barriers to entry (anyone with a phone could download games)  
    3. Result: More gamers, larger market  

3. **AI’s Potential Impact**  
    1. Is this revolution bigger than mobile?  
        - AI already assists with coding, dialogue writing, and storyboarding  
        - Impacts both game development and player experience

### Two Realistic Scenarios  

**Base Case (Incremental Improvements)**  
- **NPC Dialogues**: Dynamic instead of scripted  
- **Procedural Content**: AI-generated worlds (like No Man’s Sky but better)  
- **Developer Efficiency**: Less time spent on repetitive tasks  

**Predictable Outcomes**  
1. More games released annually  
2. Studios focus on core gameplay/story over NPC interactions  
3. Cutscenes powered by language-aware AI models  
4. Niche genres thrive due to lower development costs  

**Metrics to Monitor**  
- Number of new games on Steam/App Store  
- Player retention rates for AI-enhanced games  

---

**Hero Case (Breakthroughs)**  
- Sudden leaps in AI capabilities (e.g., code generation in 2022)  
- Could gaming become radically more accessible/affordable?  

**Questions to Answer**  
1. Would AI-driven games attract new demographics?  
2. Can gaming costs drop significantly?  
3. What business metrics matter (revenue, DAUs, playtime)?  

---

# Conclusion: Will AI Transform Gaming in 5-10 Years?  

1. **Impact Direction**: Likely positive  
2. **Quantifiable Evidence Needed**: Market size projections (e.g., "Gaming AI to grow 100% by 2035")  
> Action Item: Research analyst reports on specific sectors  

---

# Broader Implications  

1. **B2B vs. B2C**: Which is more AI-ready?  
2. **GPU Parallel**: Just as GPU advances enabled realistic graphics, AI could revolutionize NPCs  
3. **Development Speed**: Faster game/software creation matters because… [To be expanded]
