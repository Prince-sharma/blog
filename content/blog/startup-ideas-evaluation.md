## List of all the things I could be doing right now

### TO Do
1. Look ar YC startup directory, specially for companies after LLMs 
2. Look at some other startup database? who's getting funded? 
3. What's my unfair advantage? what type of customers I like talking to? What problem I can work on for the next 10 years of my life?
