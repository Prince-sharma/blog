### **Case Study Tasks:**

Use the structure below to complete your case study submission:

***

**1. Market Research & Competitive Analysis:**

- **Question:** How would you analyze the competitive landscape for Docsumo, given the established players and new-age competitors (Abbyy, Kofax, Google Document AI, etc.)?

  - Identify the key differentiators for Docsumo.

  - Propose a strategic positioning plan to capture more of the mid-market segment.

**Context from Product Thesis:**Docsumo excels in document classification and data extraction from complex unstructured documents with a higher accuracy rate than traditional OCR tools. Additionally, Docsumo’s ability to process diverse document types at scale is a competitive advantage, especially in areas like financial services and commercial lending​

***

**2. Product Vision & Roadmap (3, 6, and 12 months):**

- **Question:** What would your 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month product vision look like?

  - Which features or capabilities would you prioritize to align with Docsumo's mission?

  - How will you balance short-term wins with long-term product scalability?

**Context from Product Thesis:**Docsumo’s roadmap needs to focus on enhancing its AI models for increased accuracy and expanding integrations to become a core part of enterprise workflows. The product vision should be centered on creating a seamless customer experience, addressing current pain points like manual processes, and driving automation​.

***

**3. Customer Segmentation & Use Cases:**

- **Question:** How would you define the ideal customer profile for Docsumo?

  - Which specific use cases will you prioritize (e.g., customer onboarding, claims processing) to demonstrate immediate value?

**Context from Product Thesis:**Mid-market financial services, commercial lending and B2B technology companies are a primary target, given their reliance on document-heavy processes. The use cases around automating manual data entry from bank statements, payment processing, and tax documents are key areas where Docsumo can demonstrate significant ROI

***

**4. Success Metrics & Adoption Strategy:**

- **Question:** What success metrics would you track to gauge the impact of newly launched features?

  - How would you drive feature adoption among customers?

**Context from Product Thesis:**The success of new features should be measured through user engagement (e.g., feature usage, reduction in manual errors, time savings) and business outcomes (e.g., increased customer retention, decreased churn). Adoption should be driven through targeted customer education and onboarding strategies​.

***

**5. Go-to-Market Strategy for New Integrations:**

- **Question:** How would you approach the go-to-market strategy for new integrations?

  - The integrations are for Google Drive, Box, Dropbox, S3, SharePoint, and OneDrive for imports; Google Sheets and Smartsheet for exports.

**Context from Product Thesis:**Docsumo currently allows document uploads via API, email forwarding, and Zapier, but a broader strategy is needed to provide native integrations. The addition of these key integrations will streamline customer workflows, allowing them to manage the entire process within Docsumo​. Your strategy should include clear communication on the value these integrations provide and a launch plan targeting mid-market customers who rely on cloud-based document storage solutions.

***

**6. User Research & Feedback Loop for Integrations:**

- **Question:** How would you integrate user feedback into the product lifecycle, specifically for the new integrations?

  - What mechanisms will you use to gather feedback and iterate on the feature post-launch?

**Context from Product Thesis:**Establishing a continuous feedback loop is crucial. You can leverage in-app surveys, interviews, and analytics to understand how customers interact with these integrations. Iteration should focus on ensuring seamless document flow from third-party storage solutions into Docsumo and vice versa​.
