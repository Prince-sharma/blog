# Learning about myself

What I like:

Sitting in a cab travelling to somehwhere, with various types of things happening otside the wondow
Travelling on local / flight where i get to see what different life people have, what are thier experocnes, what do they do, how do they live life
Travelling anywhere i get to meet people and can peek into their lives to undersatnd what kind of person they and what do they enjoy and what is importtant for them 
Rain, setting sun, eary morning (blue), blue skies with clouds

What are you afraid of?


Family and stuff

There are poeple who ahve had very less life experices overall compared to you

There will be people who have had much more life experices than you

There will be people who are much poor than you or people who are much rich than you

There will be people who have better family situations than you, there will be people who will have worse family situations than you

This feeling of beign able to control how people behave withyou is new to me? earlier when i was a kid

What the socity expects of you
Do X, have a kid, etc

# Notes on self / life

I watch movies and try to learn what they capture about life intrincially. 
Naruto / One peice has a bunch of friends doing things
coming of age movies have people beahve a certain way

And then draw similarities between these movies / shows and real life

In one peice there a whole complex world out there, Luffy who doesn't know much shouts that he'll become the pirate king one day and goes on with it. 
What he really does is act based one some principals that he has, but has all the confidence, belives in himself that he'll do it and keeps going
The world itself can be a very comsplicated place, many things happening aroud: Jobs, Business, Art, Music, Performance, Living in a different country, 
Making real experinces take time, you need to have spend some time with that really close friend
At the same time when you move forward, you sometimes leave your past friends, experinces, etc and this leads to a better you? 
Bhadu? colledge v/s now?

One other thing that i like to do from time to time

Remeber what i was like when I was in class 9-10, 11-12 the pre JEE and JEE times and also during the drop year
What happend in colledge and 
What happend in work year till now ~4 

Other thing: try to understand the world view of other people that I know well or don't know well

A thing/day/way/something that I really hate is not doing anything, or not able to do something beacuse i constraint myself

Be ambitious and have a bais for action

1. Neongensis evangalion [The transcript from the anime](https://www.oocities.org/gorene/text/Episode26.txt)

The truth is something we never really know
What you experince at any given time are mere facts. Your own set of facts.
And memory of those facts gradually become your reality.
Some truths chnage and transform over time. 

There are a lot of facts, this is just one. 

This is reality. What is relality? 
The world arounf you.
Your own world, one that exists alongside time and space and other people. 
A world you yourself choose how to interpret and accept things.
Right now, it's a world made up of only what was given to you. 

A world of your own that you have no control over. 
You mean a world where everyting is decided for me, right?!
No, it's not. It's a world where you make the decisions.
It's a world where your heart decides how things will be.

This is the world that you wished for, The shape that's taken here is one possible ending.

What am I? Who am I?
This...it's me
The shape that I show to others. the symbol for me.
So is this (photo), nd this (name), nd this!
