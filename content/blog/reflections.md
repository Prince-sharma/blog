# Notes on self / life

1. Neongensis evangalion

The truth is something we never really know
What you experince at any given time are mere facts. Your own set of facts.
And memory of those facts gradually become your reality.
Some truths chnage and transform over time. 

There are a lot of facts, this is just one. 

This is reality. What is relality? 
The world arounf you.
Your own world, one that exists alongside time and space and other people. 
A world you yourself choose how to interpret and accept things.
Right now, it's a world made up of only what was given to you. 

A world of your own that you have no control over. 
You mean a world where everyting is decided for me, right?!
No, it's not. It's a world where you make the decisions.
It's a world where your heart decides how things will be.

This is the world that you wished for, The shape that's taken here is one possible ending.
